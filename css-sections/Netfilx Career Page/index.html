                                Netflix is one of the world's leading entertainment services, with 283 million paid

                                in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of
                                genres and

                                components and libraries. We help them focus on innovation by reducing the complexity of
                                building and managing software. Developer experience runs deep in our DNA and influences
                                every
                                facet of our work.<br><br>
